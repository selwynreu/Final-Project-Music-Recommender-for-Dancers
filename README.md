# LHL_FinalProject - Music Recommender for Dancers

## Project Overview

DanceTunes is a project aimed at providing personalized music recommendations tailored specifically for dancers. Whether you're a professional dancer, choreographer, or simply someone who loves to dance, this tool helps you discover music that matches your style, tempo preferences, and mood.


## Process
1. **Data Collection**: We collect data from Spotify, including audio features on popular songs over the years.
2. **Data Cleaning**: We clean the dataset to make sure there were no duplicate records or missing values and decided to condense the number of features to be included.
3. **Feature Engineering**: We focus on features such as danceability, speechiness, valence, tempo, and popularity of the songs. 
4. **User Interface**: We provide a user-friendly interface where users can input their preferences and receive personalized music recommendations instantly.

## Results
- Personalized music recommendations based on a song that users would input.
- Enhanced dance experience with music that complements your movements based on your song choices.

## Challenges
- **Data Collection**: There were API rate limits which affected my ability to gather more data for a user's profile.
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the data collected from various sources and having a limited resource.
- **User Feedback**: Incorporating user feedback to continuously improve the recommendation system.

## Future Goals
- **Expand Music Database**: Increase the diversity of music genres and styles to cater to a wider audience.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: Implementing advanced machine learning techniques to provide even more personalized recommendations.
- **Community Engagement**: Building a vibrant community where dancers can share their favorite music and dance routines.
